Free copyright notice: drafting notes
This is a copyright notice (or copyright statement) template, designed for use on a website.
Copyright is one of the cornerstone intellectual property rights. Although websites as such do not attract copyright protection, they are made up of works that do (literary works, graphical works and so on).
Using this template, the website operator may assert ownership of copyright in the website, and set out the basis upon which others may use the website.
In addition, the notice incorporates special provisions relating to copyright infringement and copyright-related notifications.
The template may be used on its own, or it may form part of a website's terms and conditions of use.
Section 1: Credit
Section: Free documents licensing warning
Optional element. Although you need to retain the credit, you should remove the inline copyright warning from this document before use.
Section 2: Copyright notice
Section 2.1
What was the year of first publication of the relevant copyright material (or the range of years)?
Who is the principal owner of copyright in the website?
Section 3: Copyright licence
Optional element.
The scope of the licence to use will vary with each site. Consider carefully exactly what your users should be allowed to do with your website and material on your website.
Section 3.1
Will audio and/or video files be published on the website?
Will the website make available any dynamic services to users?
Describe the website services in question.
Section 3.2

Section 3.3

For what purposes may the website be used?
Section 3.4

Section 3.5
Optional element.
Section 4: Acceptable use
Optional element.
Section 5: Report abuse
Will there be a special procedure (which could be as simple as a designated email address) for reporting abusive conduct or materials on the website?
Websites that allow the publication of user generated content should incorporate an abuse reporting procedure. The existence of such a procedure may help the website operator to take advantage of certain defences that may be available in respect of such user generated content. For instance, the website operator defence set out in Section 5 of the Defamation Act 2013 and elaborated in the Defamation (Operators of Websites) Regulations 2013 will only be available where the operator has responded to a notice of complaint sent by the complainant, a process which may be made simpler by the use of a dedicated communications channel. The guidance notes accompanying the legislation have this to say on the subject: "The Government encourages operators to set up and publicise a designated email address for this purpose as a matter of good practice, which we encourage complainants to use. Operators may also wish to provide an online form that complainants can use to submit a Notice of Complaint".
Section 5.2
Optional element.
How can users report unlawful and unwanted materials and activities on the website?
Section 6: Enforcement of copyright
Optional element.
Section 7: Permissions
